This repository contains the full list of tested websites and Android apps featuring virtual try-on (VTO) in the study. For every website/app in the list, we indicate the following:
* URL and package name of website and app, respectively
* number of downloads (apps only)
* whether the app is pure VTO or not [^1] (apps only)
* whether a user's image is sent to a 3rd-party server when using the VTO feature
* whether a user's image is stored when using the VTO feature
* whether the app/website violates its privacy policy, and on what basis (violation type)
* whether the app/website violates use a VTO provider which violates its own privacy policy, and on what basis (violation type)
* whether the website displays a misleading disclaimer that gives false confidence to the user on using th VTO feature (websites only)

There are four files:

* **List of Android Apps Featuring VTO.pdf**: the full list of the tested 28 apps in PDF format (more readable).
* **List of Websites Featuring VTO.csv**: the full list of the tested 138 websites in CSV format.
* **List of Websites Featuring VTO.pdf**: the full list of the tested 138 websites in PDF format (more readable).

[^1]: An app is considered pure VTO if the VTO or AR feature is explicitly advertised as a main feature in the app's description. We consider a non-pure VTO app to be one that does not advertise VTO or AR as a main feature in its description.

**Note regarding apps list**: We classify apps into either being _pure VTO_ or _non-pure VTO_. An app is considered _pure VTO_ if the VTO or AR feature is explicitly advertised as a main feature in the app's description, such as apps for eye-wear with VTO. We consider a _non-pure VTO_ app to be one that does not advertise VTO or AR as a main feature in its description, such as a general online marketplace app which allows VTO for some products. See column 3 in apps' table for this classification.
